## This assignment is optional!
<br>
Goal:  Create the most predictive Titanic survival model you can build.
<br>
This is your opportunity to show me what you can do.  My guest lecturer Jason built a pretty good model using the Titanic data.   Can you do better?   
<br>
Rules:
<br>
Random Forest would be a very good choice for this assignment, however you can use ANY classifier you'd like.   You could even use more than one classifer if you'd like.   The choice is yours.
<br>
You can use any feature/variable in the dataset you'd like.   You may derive new features.   You're going to have to think through the variables, experiment, and decide which will best help your model.
<br>
You can choose any imputation strategy you'd like, or none at all.
<br>
You can work as a team or collaborate (please do) but you must submit your work individually.

Still want more?  Great!  If you can beat my undisclosed AUC, I will make that worth 50 extra credit points!
